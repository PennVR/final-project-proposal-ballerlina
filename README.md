# Final Project Proposals
### Carolina Zheng

#### 1. Cooking game
A cooking simulation where you're scored based on how well you prepare dishes. Use the nunchucks to control your hands. Could be fun to make it Surgeon Simulator style where it's purposefully difficult to manipulate your hands properly, and add mechanics where you can mess up cooking in funny ways.

#### 2. Interactive file system/IDE
How can you take advantage of VR to provide a more immersive experience when someone is using their computer? Keyboard shortcuts can be replaced by hand and arm gestures, and users can use the increased space real estate to multitask more efficiently.

#### 3. Maze creation
The goal would be to write a maze generation algorithm that would simulate travelling through a maze even though the player is actually confined to walking within a fixed space. The challenging part would be the algorithm design rather than the graphical component.
